Sorting is essential in this solution because it simplifies the process of finding the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values of any subset of size 
𝑘
k. Let’s delve into why sorting is necessary and its role in solving this problem efficiently.

Why Sorting?
The core idea is to ensure that the subset of size 
𝑘
k always consists of consecutive elements in the array. This way:

Minimizing Difference: In a sorted array, the elements that are closest in value are located next to each other. This means that the subset with the smallest difference between the maximum and minimum values can always be found in a contiguous segment of the sorted array.
Efficiency: Sorting reduces the need to check all possible subsets of size 
𝑘
k, which would otherwise require generating combinations (a computationally expensive operation). By sorting, we can simply slide a window of size 
𝑘
k across the array to compute the difference.


  Let me explain with a detailed example why sorting reduces the need to check all possible subsets of size 
𝑘
k, and how it simplifies the process by allowing us to use a sliding window.

Problem Overview
We want to find the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values of any subset of size 
𝑘
k. If we don't sort the array, we have to explore all possible subsets of size 
𝑘
k, which is computationally expensive. Sorting allows us to focus on consecutive subsets only.
Without Sorting

Why Sorting Works
Consecutive Elements in Sorted Array:

In a sorted array, elements that are numerically closest will be adjacent. For example:
In 
[
1
,
4
,
7
,
9
]
[1,4,7,9], the difference between 
1
1 and 
4
4 is smaller than between 
1
1 and 
7
7 or 
1
1 and 
9
9.
Thus, to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a subset of size 
𝑘
k, we only need to consider contiguous segments of the sorted array.
No Need to Check All Subsets:

Instead of generating all possible subsets of size 
𝑘
k (e.g., 
{
9
,
4
}
,
{
9
,
1
}
,
…
{9,4},{9,1},…), sorting guarantees that any subset with the smallest difference will be represented as a contiguous subarray.
Efficiency of Sliding Window:

By iterating over the sorted array with a sliding window of size 
𝑘
k, we calculate the difference between the first and last elements of each window, which is guaranteed to give the minimum difference for that subset.
Comparing Results
For 
𝑛
𝑢
𝑚
𝑠
=
[
9
,
4
,
1
,
7
]
nums=[9,4,1,7] and 
𝑘
=
2
k=2:

Without sorting: 
2
2 (found by exhaustively checking all subsets).
With sorting: 
2
2 (found efficiently using a sliding window).
