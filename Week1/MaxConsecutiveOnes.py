This line is a key part of the sliding window approach. Here’s what it means and why it’s necessary:

Context:
In the sliding window approach, the window (the range between start and end) should only contain consecutive 1s. If we encounter a 0, the sequence of consecutive 1s is interrupted. At this point, we need to reset the starting position (start) of the window to exclude the 0 and start
