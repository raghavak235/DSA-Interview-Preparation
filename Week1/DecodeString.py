The decodeString function is designed to decode encoded strings that follow the pattern k[encoded_string], where k is a positive integer indicating the number of times the encoded_string should be repeated. This pattern can be nested, and the function uses a stack-based approach to handle such cases.

Function Explanation:

Initialization:

An empty list stack is initialized to help manage characters and decoded substrings.
Iterating Through the Input String:

The function iterates over each character i in the input string s.
Handling Different Characters:

Non-']' Characters:
If the character is not a closing bracket ']', it is appended to the stack. This includes digits, letters, and the opening bracket '['.
Closing Bracket ']':
When a closing bracket is encountered, it signifies the end of an encoded segment. The function then performs the following steps:
Extract Encoded String:
Initialize an empty string curr_str.
Pop characters from the stack until an opening bracket '[' is encountered, constructing the encoded substring in reverse order.
Pop the opening bracket '[' from the stack.
Determine the Multiplier:
Initialize an empty string digit.
Pop characters from the stack as long as they are digits, building the multiplier in reverse order.
Convert the digit string to an integer to get the repetition count.
Repeat and Append:
Repeat the decoded substring curr_str by the multiplier and append the result back onto the stack.
Final Assembly:

After processing all characters, the stack contains the decoded segments. Joining these segments yields the fully decoded string.
Example Walkthrough:

Let's decode the string 3[a2[c]] step by step:

Initial State:

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Stack: []
Processing '3':

Stack: ['3']
Processing '[':

Stack: ['3', '[']
Processing 'a':

Stack: ['3', '[', 'a']
Processing '2':

Stack: ['3', '[', 'a', '2']
Processing '[':

Stack: ['3', '[', 'a', '2', '[']
Processing 'c':

Stack: ['3', '[', 'a', '2', '[', 'c']
Processing ']':

Pop 'c' to form curr_str = 'c'.
Pop '['.
Pop '2' to form digit = '2'.
Repeat curr_str by digit: 'c' * 2 = 'cc'.
Stack: ['3', '[', 'a', 'cc']
Processing ']':

Pop 'cc' and 'a' to form curr_str = 'acc'.
Pop '['.
Pop '3' to form digit = '3'.
Repeat curr_str by digit: 'acc' * 3 = 'accaccacc'.
Stack: ['accaccacc']
Final Output:

Join the stack to get 'accaccacc'.
This approach effectively decodes the string by leveraging a stack to manage nested encoded patterns, ensuring that each segment is processed in the correct order.
